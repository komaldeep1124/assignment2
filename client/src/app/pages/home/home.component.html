        I want the world to be a better place because of my actions, and because
        of the impact I have on other people. Also, on my bad days, where it
        seems I can't do anything right, I hope I don't mess things up too
        badly. I feel a good attitude, whether it is at sports or in the office,
        is a valuable mentoring device. With that said, I will take the
        opportunity to act as an example and teach anyone I meet.<br /><br />
